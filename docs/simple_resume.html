<h4>Graphics Engine Software Developer</h4>
<h5>Metecs - Houston, Texas</h5>
<ul>

</ul>

<h5>May 2017 - June 2022</h5>
<h4>Benoit Premium Threading - Houston, Texas</h4>
<h4> - Lead Software Engineer (October 2020)</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Developed and maintained various in-house software suites.</li>
    <li>Developed embedded systems.</li>
    <li>Developed 3D renderer.</li>
    <li>Developed an automated connection gauging system.</li>
</ul>

<h4> - Lead Design Engineer (May 2019)</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Guided and trained a small team of engineers and student workers.</li>
    <li>Automated various types of analyses.</li>
    <li>Created software tools to aid in design.</li>
</ul>

<h4> - Mechanical Engineer (May 2017)</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Performed stress analysis on new and existing threaded connections using the finite element method.</li>
    <li>Created manufacturing drawing for production of new products.</li>
    <li>Designed new premium and semi-premium threaded connections that are currently in use today.</li>
</ul>

<h5>October 2014 - May 2017</h5>
<h4>Mechanical Engineering Student Worker</h4>
<h5>PAI Engineering - Baton Rouge, Louisiana</h5>
<ul>
    <li>Extended open-source software for Computation Fluid Dynamics (CFD) using C++.</li>
    <li>Created GUIs with Python for existing headless programs.</li>

    Dear PyGui is a Python GUI framework written in C++ and built with Dear ImGui. The library simulates a
    traditional retained mode GUI as opposed to Dear ImGui's immediate mode paradigm. The library has
    continued to grow in popularity approaching 5500 stars, 30+ sponsors, and 500,000 downloads.
    We currently utilize Directx11, Metal, and OpenGL as the backend graphics APIs.
